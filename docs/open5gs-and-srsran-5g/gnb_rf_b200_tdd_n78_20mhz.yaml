# This configuration file example shows how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to allow srsUE to connect to it. 
# This specific example uses ZMQ in place of a USRP for the RF-frontend, and creates an FDD cell with 10 MHz bandwidth. 
# To run the srsRAN Project gNB with this config, use the following command: 
#   sudo ./gnb -c gnb_zmq.yaml

amf:
  addr: ${AMF_ADDR}                 # The address or hostname of the AMF.
  bind_addr: ${AMF_BIND_ADDR}       # A local IP that the gNB binds to for traffic from the AMF.
